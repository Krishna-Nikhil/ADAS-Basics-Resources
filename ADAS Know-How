- Physics for ADAS:    
  - Rectilinear Motion: Relevant. Ego vehicles often move along straight paths, especially on highways or in urban driving scenarios.
  - Curvilinear Motion: Relevant. Ego vehicles frequently encounter curved paths, such as when navigating bends in the road or making turns at intersections.
  - Angular Kinematics: Relevant. Understanding the rotational motion of vehicle components, such as wheels or steering mechanisms, is important for ego kinematics and ADAS.
  - Relative Motion: Highly relevant. Understanding the relative motion of the ego vehicle with respect to other objects, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles, is essential for ADAS functionality like collision avoidance and lane keeping.
  - Differential Kinematics: Relevant. Differential kinematics is crucial for understanding how the velocities and accelerations of different parts of the vehicle, such as individual wheels or axles, contribute to overall vehicle motion.
  - Kinematic Constraints: Relevant. Kinematic constraints play a role in understanding the limitations and capabilities of the vehicle's mechanical structure, such as its steering range or suspension characteristics.
  - Motion Analysis: Relevant. Motion analysis techniques may be used in ADAS development for analyzing vehicle dynamics, detecting and tracking objects, and understanding driver behavior.
